Welcome to Skylable SX!
-----------------------

This is a beta release of Skylable SX. We have put a lot of efforts to make
your experience as good as possible. As it usually is, a beta release comes
with some limitations but it has been reliably running on our internal
production cluster for the past few months without any major issues.

To get started please see doc/quickstart/quickstart.pdf

The binary packages are available at: http://cdn.skylable.com/packages/

If you find any bugs, please report them to our bugzilla:
