Welcome to Skylable SX!
-----------------------

This is the first beta of Skylable SX. We have put a lot of efforts to make
your experience as good as possible. As it usually is, a beta release comes
with some limitations but it has been reliably running on our internal
production cluster for the past 3 months without any major issues.

To get started please see doc/quickstart/quickstart.pdf

If you find any bugs, please report them to our bugzilla:

Enjoy!
