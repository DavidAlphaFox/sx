1 - make the client ask for filenodes and use them for subsequent ops
remove the LS call to get the blocksize and add a call to get blocksize and filenodes
hdist(vol + hash)

*2 - make the filenode generate a smart token (this is partially done)


3 - make the hashnodes pull the token unless they have it already


4 - on flush the file node shall invorm the volumenodes/wholecluster about the operation


5 - on flush we must sync (i.e. PUSH) the file on teh other filenodes
