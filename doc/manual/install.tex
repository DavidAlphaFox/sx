\chapter{Installation}

\section*{Requirements}

Skylable \SX is tested on all popular UNIX platforms, including Linux,
FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. We try to support as many platforms as possible,
if you have troubles installing, compiling or running our software on
your platform please open a bug report.

The latest binary packages are available at:

In order to compile \SX from source, you
will need the following packages to be installed together with their
development versions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenSSL/NSS
    \item libcurl >= 7.34.0 (otherwise the embedded one will be used)
    \item zlib
\end{itemize}
For example, on Debian run:
\small
\begin{lstlisting}
# apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libz-dev
\end{lstlisting}
\LARGE

\section*{Compilation}

The software is based on autoconf, so just follow the standard installation
procedure. In this guide we will install \SX into \path{/opt/sx}.
\small
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/sx && make
# make install
\end{lstlisting}
