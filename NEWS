0.4 (Fourth Beta)
-----------------

This release contains important enhancements and bugfixes, including:

  * Automatic rebalance when nodes are added, modified or removed
    from the cluster
  * aes256 filter now uses the AES-256-CBC-HMAC-512 mode and bcrypt for
    key derivation
  * sxcp --one-file-system support (to not cross filesystem boundaries)
  * sxcp can now limit the number of connections (global and per host), see
    --full-help for usage information
  * Many usability enhancements in the client tools
  * Other improvements and bugfixes

0.3 (Third Beta)
----------------

The key features and improvements in this release include:

  * Support for using a custom port number (configure with sxsetup --advanced).
    This also allows sxsetup to run without root privileges when SX is
    configured to run on a port higher than 1024.
  * sxcp now displays a progress bar while transferring files
  * sxcp --bwlimit support (to set a bandwidth usage limit)
  * configure --with-system-libs support (to force the use of system libraries
    instead of those bundled in 3rdparty/)
  * Many minor improvements and bugfixes

0.2 (Second Beta)
-----------------

Changes in this release include:

  * Support for building with either NSS or OpenSSL
  * Minimum Curl version supported is now 7.34.0 (configure will use the
    embedded version if the system's one is not supported - this allows
    out-of-box build on CentOS 6)
  * aes256 filter now generates per-volume salts; in order to preserve
    deduplication support across different volumes using the same password
    you can force a static salt, eg. --filter aes256="salt:af6a812ad0b1cb22"
  * sxinit --force-reinit support (to recreate the entire local cluster config)
  * sxinit --list support (to list all configured clusters and profiles)
  * sxinit --alias support (to assign an alias for easy access), see
    https://wiki.skylable.com/wiki/Sxinit#Aliases
  * sxls -l now also lists filters used by volumes
  * Other bugfixes and improvements

0.1 (First Beta)
----------------
