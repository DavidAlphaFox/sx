0.2 (Second Beta)
-----------------

Changes in this release include:

  * Support for building with either NSS or OpenSSL
  * Minimum Curl version supported is now 7.34.0 (configure will use the
    embedded version if the system's one is not supported - this allows
    out-of-box build on CentOS 6)
  * aes256 filter now generates per-volume salts; in order to preserve
    deduplication support across different volumes using the same password
    you can force a static salt, eg. --filter aes256="salt:af6a812ad0b1cb22"
  * sxinit --force-reinit support (to recreate the entire local cluster config)
  * sxinit --list support (to list all configured clusters and profiles)
  * sxinit --alias support (to assign an alias for easy access), see
    https://wiki.skylable.com/wiki/Sxinit#Aliases
  * sxls -l now also lists filters used by volumes
  * Other bugfixes and improvements
