      Thanks to Wandenberg Peixoto.

v0.1.2 [Wed Sep 23 2015 YoungJoo.Kim <vozlt@vozlt.com>]
    * Bugfix: added cache variable's lock routine in
      ngx_http_vhost_traffic_status_shm_add_cache() for issues/19

    * Compatibility: added overflow handling routines of variables.
      It deals with the overflow of both 32bit and 64bit variables
      but I think that not be useful in 64bit variable(Max:16EB) at this moment.
