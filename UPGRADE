Upgrade notes for SX 2.0
------------------------

Skylable SX 2.0 is backward compatible with SX 1.2, except for the aes256
filter. The data from the encrypted volumes will only be accessible with
SX 1.2 client tools, and therefore those volumes should be recreated with
the new filter.

To take advantage of the new features and improvements, a basic cluster
upgrade procedure is required: simply run 'sxsetup --upgrade' on each
node after upgrading to 2.0. IMPORTANT: Due to substantial changes
and improvements, all nodes must be upgraded to 2.0 otherwise some
operations will only work in read-only mode.

For more information, see the section 2.4 of the User Manual (manual.pdf),
